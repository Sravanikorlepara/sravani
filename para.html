                    <P>A home page is the primary web page that a visitor will view when they navigate to a website via a search engine, and it may also function as a landing page to attract visitors.[3] In some cases, the home page is a site directory, particularly when a website has multiple home pages.

                              Good home page design is usually a high priority for a website;[4] for example, a news website may curate headlines and first paragraphs of top stories, with links to full articles.[5][6] According to Homepage Usability, the homepage is the "most important page on any website" and receives the most views of any page.[7] A poorly designed home page can overwhelm and deter visitors from the site.[6] One important use of home pages is communicating the identity and value of a company.[8]</P>
